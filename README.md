# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning-based project designed to analyze and identify human emotions from speech data. This system processes audio inputs to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. By leveraging advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to deliver accurate emotion predictions based on the spoken language.

## Features

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), chroma, and spectral contrast from audio signals.
- **Emotion Classification**: Detects and classifies emotions into predefined categories like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN, or RNN) to train on labeled datasets.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Capable of processing both live audio or pre-recorded audio files.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Librosa` for audio processing
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `TensorFlow/Keras` for deep learning models
  - `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- **Dataset**: Publicly available datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or custom datasets.
