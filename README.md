# Speech-Emotion-RecognitionSpeech Emotion Recognition
Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning-based project aimed at analyzing and identifying human emotions from speech data. The system processes audio inputs to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. This project leverages advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate emotion predictions.

Features
Audio Preprocessing: Extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), chroma, and spectral contrast from audio signals.
Emotion Classification: Detects and classifies emotions into predefined categories.
Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN, or RNN) to train on labeled datasets.
Real-time Analysis: Capable of processing live audio or pre-recorded audio files.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib
Dataset: Publicly available datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or custom datasets.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/speech-emotion-recognition.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd speech-emotion-recognition
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the audio dataset using the data_preprocessing.py script.
Train the model using the train_model.py script.
Use the predict.py script to classify emotions in new audio files.
Example
python predict.py --file sample_audio.wav
Output:

Predicted Emotion: Happy
