# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

**Overview**
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning-based project aimed at analyzing and identifying human emotions from speech data. The system processes audio inputs to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. This project leverages advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to deliver accurate emotion predictions.


**Features**
**Audio Preprocessing**: Extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), chroma, and spectral contrast from audio signals.
**Emotion Classification**: Detects and classifies emotions into predefined categories.
**Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN, or RNN) to train on labeled datasets.
**Real-time Analysis**: Capable of processing live audio or pre-recorded audio files.
