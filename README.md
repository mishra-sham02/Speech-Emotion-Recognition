# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning-based project designed to analyze and identify human emotions from speech data. This system processes audio inputs to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more. By leveraging advanced audio processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to deliver accurate emotion predictions based on the spoken language.

## Features

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Extracts features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), chroma, and spectral contrast from audio signals.
- **Emotion Classification**: Detects and classifies emotions into predefined categories like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, CNN, or RNN) to train on labeled datasets.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Capable of processing both live audio or pre-recorded audio files.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Librosa` for audio processing
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` for data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `TensorFlow/Keras` for deep learning models
  - `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- **Dataset**: Publicly available datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, or custom datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/speech-emotion-recognition.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt





## Usage


1. **Preprocess the audio dataset:** Use the data_preprocessing.py script to extract features from the audio dataset.
   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
2. **Train the model:** Train the emotion classification model using the train_model.py script.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
3. **Predict emotions in new audio files:** Use the predict.py script to classify emotions in new audio files.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --file sample_audio.wav
